# Arma RCon Class (ARC) 2.0 for PHP 

ARC allows you connecting and sending commands easily via RCon to your ARMA game server. See "Supported Servers" for a list of supported games.
<br>
### ATTENTION: This version is currently in testing, do not use this in production!

<br>
<br>
## Supported Servers
Please consider that mods normally don't change the BattlEye server settings, so this class also works for sending RCON commands  to servers running mods (e.g Altis Life, DayZ, Epoch etc.).

| App ID        | Game          | RCON Support       |
|---------------|---------------|:------------------:|
|233780         | Arma 3        | :white_check_mark: |
|------         | DayZ Standalone*        | :white_check_mark: |
|33935          | Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead       | :white_check_mark: |
|33905          | Arma 2        | :white_check_mark: |
*RCon is only usable on Privates Hives of DayZ SA Servers (thanks to JaG-v2)
<br>
## Requirements
ARC requires **PHP 5.3** or higher, nothing more!
<br>
<br>
## Installation 
#### Via Composer
If you haven't already, download Composer
```shell
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
Now require and install ARC
```shell
$ composer require nizarii/arma-rcon-class
$ composer install
```
#### Without Composer
Just include the bootstrapper: `require_once 'ArmaRConClass/bootstrap.php';` 
<br>
<br>
## Examples
#### New in 2.0
```php
$rcon = new \Nizarii\ArmaRConClass\ARC(['timeout_sec' => 1]); // 'timeout_sec' is by default 1

// Create multiple connections with one ARC object
$server1 = $rcon->connnect("Your server IP 1", Port1, "RCon password 1");
$server2 = $rcon->connnect("Your server IP 2", Port2, "RCon password 2");

$result = $server2->command("Say -1 hello!");

// Only possible with functions that don't return an answer from the server
$server2
    ->sayGlobal('hello!')
    ->loadScripts()
    ;
    
```
Sending a heartbeat packet is not possible anymore in version 2.0.
